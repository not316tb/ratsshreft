# About Me
Yo, what's up. I'm David, a lead at Studio 7 Development, and I like making software that does stuff it probably shouldn't. I work mostly in C# (.NET Framework), JavaScript, and Python, but I do know how to write in Rust, Ruby, Java (barely), C++, Lua, and Shell. I know you're here for Magma, but please feel free to poke around my repos, maybe you'll find something interesting!

# Updates & Info
### [*PSA*] Magma's back, baby!
Yeah, you heard it right. Magma is back, and finally working again! After alot of back and forth with various external persons, Anemo API (the heart of the Executor) has finally been updated and unpatched. Because of this, v2.1 Development can also continue (so stay tuned for updates).

<br/><br/>

#### ~~[*PSA*] Don't use any of the DLLs that come with Magma~~
> ###### ~~It was discovered that some of the stock DLLs were viruses, and that the only 100% safe one is the GMod Lmaobox DLL (GLuaLoader.dll) seen in the YouTube showcase. I have finally removed the viruses, but still be careful when looking for / downloading your own. If you still feel unsafe about the executable itself, feel free to compile it yourself since that's part of the reason I made it open sourced.~~

#### [*FAQ*] Use OwlHub instead of DarkHub
> ###### Seems like DarkHub is broken, and I don't think it's going to be fixed any time soon. Or ever for that matter. In the meantime I recommend checking out OwlHub as an alternative!
